"""
Assume that one is calculating ùëí^1.2 using the Maclaurin series, thenlet n = number of terms.
(A) Find approximate error and absolute relative approximateof ùëí^1.2 for each n
(B)Let us assume one wants the absolute relative approximate error to be less than 0.01%, what number n would stop the
approximation?
